# Romain Coins and Tensorflow

## Overview

An experiment with using downloaded coins with the faces of emperors and sending that through Tensorflow, to see if 
Image Learning will recognize the images with some accuracy. See the article I wrote on this use case for more details.

## Setup

### Java

The project has a Java part, which uses JSoup to get the image links and then downloads them to an images directory.

To scrape the image urls, you can run `Main` class.

Alternatively, use the Jar file. (TODO add, explanation)

### Tensorflow

TODO some info
